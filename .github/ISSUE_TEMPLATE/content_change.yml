        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - [ ] The specified content should be located in the codebase
        - [ ] The content should be updated to match the desired text exactly
        - [ ] All instances of the content should be updated if it appears in multiple places
        - [ ] The change should not break any functionality
        - [ ] The updated content should display correctly on all device sizes
        
        **Technical Implementation Notes:**
        - Check HTML files in `/src/static/` for frontend content
        - Check Python files in `/src/backend/` for backend content/data
        - Look for content in database.py for activity descriptions
        - Verify content doesn't appear in multiple files
        - Test rendering on different screen sizes
        - Consider if change affects API responses or data structure
