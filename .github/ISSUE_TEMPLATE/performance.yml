        ## For the Developer
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - [ ] The performance issue should be reproduced and measured
        - [ ] Root cause should be identified (frontend, backend, database, network)
        - [ ] Performance improvements should be implemented
        - [ ] The fix should be tested under similar conditions as reported
        - [ ] Performance should meet reasonable expectations for school environment
        
        **Technical Investigation Areas:**
        - Check network requests in browser dev tools
        - Analyze JavaScript performance and console errors
        - Review FastAPI backend response times
        - Check database query efficiency
        - Analyze static file loading (CSS, JS, images)
        - Test with different connection speeds
        - Profile memory usage and potential leaks
        - Consider caching strategies
        - Review code for inefficient algorithms or loops
