        ## For the Developer
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - [ ] The accessibility improvement should be implemented following WCAG 2.1 guidelines
        - [ ] The solution should not negatively impact other users' experience
        - [ ] Changes should be tested with appropriate assistive technologies
        - [ ] All interactive elements should be keyboard accessible
        - [ ] Color contrast should meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
        
        **Technical Implementation Notes:**
        - Add appropriate ARIA labels and roles to HTML elements
        - Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
        - Include alt text for all meaningful images
        - Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
        - Verify keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
        - Check color contrast ratios with tools like WebAIM's contrast checker
        - Consider focus indicators for keyboard users
        - Test with browser zoom up to 200%
        - Validate HTML for semantic correctness
